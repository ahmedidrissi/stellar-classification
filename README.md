# Problem statement
  Stellar classification is an important task in astronomy, as it allows us to understand the properties and behavior of different types of stars. Traditional methods for stellar classification involve manual analysis of spectral data, which is time-consuming and can be subject to human error. Machine learning has the potential to automate this process, but there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One such challenge is the lack of large, labeled datasets for training and testing machine learning models. Another challenge is the complex and non-linear relationship between the features extracted from the spectral data and the class labels, which can make it difficult to design effective machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the interpretability of the models is important in this domain, as it allows astronomers to understand the physical properties of stars based on the machine learning model's predictions.
  Thus, how to develop accurate and interpretable models that can effectively classify stars based on their spectral characteristics ?
